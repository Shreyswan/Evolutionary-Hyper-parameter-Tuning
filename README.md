This repository consists of code for Bee Colony Optimization as well as Cuckoo Search Optimization for Hyper-parameter Tuning.
the code works on any kind of Deep Learning as well as Machine Learning models. The sample code consists of a CNN model which does multi-class classification. However, it can be replaced with any model of choice with appropriate hyperparameters.

## Key components:
* Data_preprocessing.py: The file should contain the process for reading and preprocessing necessary data for the model.
* Model.py: File that should contain the architecture of the model and the function for training the model.
* bee_colony_optimisation.ipynb: File that contains code for Bee Colony Optimisation (BCO).
* cuckoo_search_optimisation.ipynb: File that contains code for Cuckoo Search Optimisation (CSO).
Any algorithm can be used for hyperparameter tuning.

## Confused which to use?
The comparison.ipynb file consists of both algorithms. it can be executed to identify which algorithm best suits your model.

** Note: The code has been written in a manner such that it takes minimal CPU/GPU resources for hyperparameter tuning, thus making it compatible with lower-end systems as well. feel free to explore by changing the number of iterations, etc. as it won't hurt the system much!!
